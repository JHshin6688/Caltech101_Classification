# Caltech101_Classification

In this project, I implemented two models that classify Caltech101 images.

The Caltech101 dataset I utilized consists of 10 categories, which are 'tick', 'trilobite', 'umbrella', 'watch', 'water_lilly', 'wheelchair', 'wild_cat', 'windsor_chair', 'wrench', and 'yin_yang'.

The first model is implemented with RF codebook, using the SIFT algorithm.

The second model is implemented with CNN, using the Keras library.
